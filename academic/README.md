# Layer A - Academic research artefact

This directory contains the paper-style narrative and evaluation/reproducibility material.

- `paper.md` - methods + design rationale (research-facing)
- `evaluation_plan.md` - how to measure performance without hand-wavy claims
- `reproducibility.md` - what is required to reproduce a run (inputs, hashes, tool versions)
- `references.bib` - BibTeX citations for key tools and databases

The academic layer shares the same core contract as the product layer:
`contracts/decision_bundle/`.
